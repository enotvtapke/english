It is argued that children should get used to working from school. Despite this point of view seems to be rational, I have some major doubts about it.

People tend to spend a significant part of their life on education. Tens of years they study in school and university only to suddenly face with the need of finding a job. This abrupt transition, being the source of great stress and frustration, will probably be more seamless for those who had a grip on how the real work feels like beforehand. People who have been acquainted with the world of work before, will definitely feel more confident searching for a job in the future. That is because they know what to expect and have no delusions about how difficult the work really is. As such, the introducing of teenagers to the work sphere from school seems to be a genuinely good idea.

Nevertheless, one should consider the sacrifice schools have to make in order to implement a new approach. Instead of studying children will be forced to spend their precious time working. Even if in the beginning of adulthood practical work skills can give an advantage, in a long term perspective a good education is what truly matters. Thus, extensive education is probably better in terms of improving teenagers' career prospects. As such, I strongly believe that making children spend their time working in a school is bad.

In conclusion, I am inclined to believe that the negatives of work in school far outweigh the positives. Although those who worked in a school can benefit from it in the beginning of their adult life, it is not worth it in the long term.
