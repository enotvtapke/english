"Some sports and entertainemt stars earn far too much money". How far do you agree with this statement?

The income of the prominent entertainment sector workers or sportsmans can be genuinely astonishing. Thus, it's no surprise that some people keep wondering why sports and entertainment stars earn so much. Aren't they paid unreasonably well for the work they do? I am inclined to believe they aren't.

One of the main concerns regarding entertainment stars earnings is the fact that people that make priceless contribution into wellbeing of society, for instance doctors, school and university teachers, firefighters, policeman etc., sometimes have unfairly low income while particular entertainment stars and sportmans get thousands and thousands of dollars for their seemingly insignificant work. In addition to this, job in entertainment sector looks easy since it lacks responsibility and hardships that people of other professions facing with.

Nevertheless, It would be unwise to underestimate the importance and difficulty of the work in entertainment sector. People naturally seek for entertainment. The sole purpose of sports and entertainment stars is to satisfy this desire of the others. This goal is far from being easy, only those who posses special set of traits are able to accomplish it. At the same time, the entertainment is crucial for the wellbeing of the person, even though it can be less important than other human needs. Therefore, work in entertainment sector is not unimportant nor easy. As a matter of fact, entertainment and sports stars are offered as much money as others are ready to give them. In other words, stars are able to earn so much only because other people allow them to do so.

In conclusion, I reckon that there is sufficient evidence to believe that high income of sports and entertainment starts is fair. People need to be entertained and ready to pay for it.
