The maps depict developments of the transport access to a city hospital from 2007 to 2010.

Overall, there can be seen a significant improvement of roads topology and areas for vehicle placement around the hospital.

One substantial change is the construction of two roundabouts to the south of the hospital. One roundabout was built in the south of map on the junction of hospital road and city road. Another roundabout was added on the north end of hospital road, right to the south of city hospital, and connected hospital road with ring road located around the hospital.

Further important alteration that took place in period from 2007 to 2010 is the separation of car park and conversion of bus stops into a bus station.
Car park that was situated to the east of hospital road was split into two. One, that was built on the east side of the map, is used for public transport. Another park, that is designated for staff, replaced old parking area. Furthermore, old bus stops located on the west and east sides of hospital road were dismantled, while bus station erected to the west of hospital road.
