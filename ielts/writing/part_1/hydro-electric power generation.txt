The diagram shows the process of hydro-electric power generation. Overall, there are 6 stages in the process, beginning with the evaporation of the water and culminating in the consumption of the generated power by the variety of facilities.

To begin, water evaporates from the sea surface under the exposure of sunlight. Evaporated water forms clouds which then fall out in the form of the rain that fills the reservoir. Following that valve blocking water access to the turbine is opened. Water stream from the reservoir gets through the dam reaching out the turbine. Next the energy of the accelerated water is transformed into the energy of electro-magnetic field by the turbine. At the same time water is pumped back to the reservoir. Before power reaches the transformer station, it is transmitted by the high voltage cables. Finally transformed current is conveyed by the underground cables to the receivers like hospitals, schools, private households, industrial facilities e.t.c.
