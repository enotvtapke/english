25.09.2023 Nelson map
The map illustrates the key developments that have taken place in the city of Nelson from 2000 to today.

Overall, the city has been tangibly modernised and extended over the recent years with the number of residential, entertainment and transport facilities have been added.

One noticeable improvement between 2000 and today is the erection of the new shopping center, covered market and shop on the north-east, south-east and south-west sides of the city respectively. These new shopping facilities have replaced an old market to the west of the city center. A further change is the introduction of the tramline connecting the city center with the university on the north of the city. To the west of the tramline a new tramline station was constructed whilst an old tramline station located on the city's west has been demolished.

Regarding the south of the city, one significant change from 2000 is the construction of the new leisure facilities along the river, as bars, clubs and a restaurant. Another interesting development is the pedestrianisation of the road which separated the port and city center. As regards to the city center, the past years have seen the introduction of a bike rental scheme.
