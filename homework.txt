It was one of my first holidays with my family. First of all, the hotel we booked was a nightmare considering how much we paid. Nearest beach was not only uncomfortable and dirty, it also was packed with people. 

At the same time buildings that were looking grade in the photos, in reality turned out to be giant concrete constructions, deserted and unlively.

Theme park also was a disaster, half of the rides were closed, another half was dull, and the queues were outrageously long.

We got ripped off in restaurants and when we buyed souvenirs at the local market.

We were glad to finally get home.



half of the rides were closed, another half was(were) dull.

On one hand this job is quite dull and badly paid. On top of that it is physically demanding. But on the other hand you have nearly no responsibilities and can easily get into that field.

You should think twice before getting into that field. Job is well-paid and has a lot of bonuses, but it's very stressful and involves a lot of paperwork.

Nowadays a growing number of people apply for this job. Even though it is very well-paid, creative and varied, it's not for everyone. You should be into your job to get by.

I always wondered how people are able to live for the minimal wage.

I hate those moments when you have no chance to think and should make decisions almost randomly.

I am not really keen on shopping neither can't I withstand it.

I am not really keen on shopping. Most of the time I find it stressful and frustrating. One can even say that I can't withstand shopping but it's not entirely true. From my point of view shopping is mostly a necessity. Nevertheless, I am always glad to buy something that at first looks good on me, then can last a decent amount of time and at last doesn't cost a fortune. Buying good things always cheers me up, I don't really mind shopping. Sometimes I even spend a little more than I should, when it's worth it. Despite that I would never agree to be in debt because I can't afford what I like. Shopping is hard, I often return empty-handed, because it's not that easy to find something that suits me. In those situations I feel like I wasted my time. That is why I have nearly no outfits that I haven't worn much. I am cautious at buying stuff, but when I buy something I use it all the time.

a letter of complaint (discord) p 35 WB 
revise vocabulary p 62 SB
ex 2, 3, 4 p 40 WB

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing in order to make a formal complaint. I placed an order for running trainers in light grey from your website on 11/02. 

I am sorry to say that I am really disappointed. The first thing I would like to draw attention to is that according to the information on your website delivery was supposed to take no more than 1 week. However, an order failed to arrive and was delivered only after a further delay of 7 days. Unfortunately it wasn't at all what I had expected. Not only had the warehouse sent out the wrong color, but the size of the trainers was way smaller than I had ordered. To make things worse, the left shoe had cracks on its sole. 

I tried to tackle this issue by contacting your customer helpdesk, but it didn't help resolving my problem in any way. I have been a regular customer of yours, but I find recent poor service unacceptable. I would be grateful if you could give me a full refund of 200$ to my account and arrange for a courier to collect the damaged trainers. 

I look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem,
Faithfully yours Aleksandr

With a few exceptions I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Some parts of course were controversial, but overall, it was a positive learning experience, which fully met my expectations. 

The training was of a high standard with a good selection of topics, but sometimes lacked practical sessions. The tutors seemed to be knowledgeable and encouraging, but they were not always well-prepared. Despite that, they were able to communicate easily with students of different levels.

The sessions were very challenging, but workload was equally distributed over trainings, which made finishing the course easy. The clear and helpful handouts summarised the main points of each session. 

At the beginning the lecture theaters weren't well-equipped, but because of the student's feedback the situation drastically changed for the better after a couple of training sessions.

I have a genuine sense of achievement after completing the course and I would definitely recommend it to the students that are keen enough to strive towards the knowledge despite negligible complications.

write the description of a diagram (id discord, read lesson tmp)

The diagram shows the process of hydro-electric power generation. Overall, there are 6 stages in the process, beginning with the evaporation of the water and culminating in the consumption of the generated power by the variety of facilities.

To begin, water evaporates from the sea surface under the exposure of sunlight. 

Evaporated water forms clouds which then fall out in the form of the rain that fills the reservoir.

Following that valve blocking water access to the turbine is opened. Water stream from the reservoir gets through the dam reaching out the turbine. 

Next the energy of the accelerated water is transformed into the energy of electro-magnetic field by the turbine. At the same time water is pumped back to the reservoir.

Before power reaches the transformer station, it is transmitted by the high voltage cables.

Finally transformed current is conveyed by the underground cables to the receivers like hospitals, schools, private households, industrial facilities e.t.c.



While current is being generated by the turbine, water is pumped back to the reservoir.



Следи за сокращениями. Не такие длинные предложения, лучше пиши факт, а потом поясняй его. Обрати внимание на логику в связках (второй и третий абзац плохо связаны). Будь смелее в использовании синонимов, очень важно не повторяться, не тащить за собой длинные "entertainment starts". Следи за артиклями.

В целом надо писать проще, хорошие сочинения несложные в плане структуры и лексики. Посмотри примеры

The income of the prominent entertainment sector workers or sportsmans can be genuinely astonishing. Thus, it's no surprise that some people keep wondering why sports and entertainment stars earn so much. Aren't they paid unreasonably well for the work they do? I am inclined to believe they aren't.

One of the main concerns regarding entertainment stars earnings is the fact that people that make priceless contribution into wellbeing of society, for instance doctors, school and university teachers, firefighters, policeman etc., sometimes have unfairly low income while particular entertainment stars and sportmans get thousands and thousands of dollars for their seemingly insignificant work. In addition to this, job in entertainment sector looks easy since it lacks responsibility and hardships that people of other professions facing with.

Nevertheless, It would be unwise to underestimate the importance and difficulty of the work in entertainment sector. People naturally seek for entertainment. The sole purpose of sports and entertainment stars is to satisfy this desire of the others. This goal is far from being easy, only those who posses special set of traits are able to accomplish it. At the same time, entertainment is crucial for the well-being of the person, even though it can be less important than other human needs. Therefore, work in entertainment sector is not unimportant nor easy. As a matter of fact, entertainment and sports stars are offered as much money as others are ready to give them. In other words, stars are able to earn so much only because other people allow them to do so.

In conclusion, I reckon that there is sufficient evidence to believe that high income of sports and entertainment starts is fair. People need to be entertained and are ready to pay for it.

The painting of the prominent russian artist Karl Brulov named "The last day of Pompeii" depicts the destruction of the ancient city of Pompeii in the result of the volcanic eruption. The painting shows crowd of people trying to escape dramatic event. In the foreground we can see a dozens of people that appear to be running towards the viewer. Behind them devastating streams of heated magma comes on the city from the mountain.

People' faces, disturbing and dreadful, are illuminated by the light. Their glances are directed towards the source of the light that cannot be seen by the viewer. This source of the light could well be another stream of lava coming towards the people, bringing them inevitable and sudden death.

Vibrant colors that are used by the author to depict people in the foreground outline the solemn beauty of the event. This beaty mixed with the tragic nature of the action taking place in the painting creates the feeling of disturbing anxiety in the viewer.

Initially, I saw this painting in the book when I was a child. Brulov's masterpiece impressed me deeply back then. 


This essay will examine the reasons for this and suggest some possible solutions.

Museums and historical sites often don't look very appealing from the perspective of the local people. This essay will examine the reasons for this and suggest some possible solutions.

There are several reasons why locals don't tend to visit places that tourists are usually being interested in. 
One of the them is the acquaintance of the locals with the culture they are surrounded with.
Local people deem that they know the culture they live in good enough, and therefore, don't see local landmarks as something worth paying attention on.
As a result, guided tours and exhibitions can't attract their attention.

One of the solutions that can be made in order to tackle this issue is an additional advertisement. Touristic companies and goverment should show locals how much interesting historical sites can be discovered in the area. The advertisement must be focused on unexpected touristing destinations or interesting although unpopular facts about well-known landmarks. For instance, it may be done by organising public events in historical areas.

Another reason why local people don't usually visit places that are outstanding from the historical perspective is unreasonably high entry fees.
Too high fees can be unappropriate or even unaffordable for those locals who are interested in history of the area. 
Many would prefer to spare money for essentials rather than spending it to visit a museum.

The solution is introducing lower fees for locals. The goverment should take actions to ensure that visiting some ancient ruins in the area don't cost a fortune and can be afforded by anyone. This can be done by subsidising museums and touristic companies so that they reduce the prices for locals.

To conclude, the lack of interest in history sites by the locals is caused by high fees and their familiarity with the culture. Goverment and touristic companies can combat this issues by both lowering entry fees and conducting extensive advertisement.

I deem that my favorite movie is fight club by regisseur David Fincher. The plot of the movie is based on Chuck Palanic's book with the same name.
The genre of the film is something in between drauma and thriller. A good friend of mine recommend me this film long time ago. One evening I remembered about this recommendation and decided to watch the movie.

The ordinary guy tired of his live and suffering from problems with sleep meets a bizzare but confident man with a strong mentality named Tyler Durden. Together they found an underground terroristic organisation to fight against the authority of big corporations.

What I like about "Fight club" the most is the deep philosophic connotations embedded in the plot. Tyler Durdon appears to be alter ego of the unnamed main character. The fight againts corporations is the fight agains dull and boring everyday rotine, a consequence of the hidden urge to self-destruction of the humans, the desire to assert your power maybe even dying in the process. All in all



Stalker. Director Andrey Tarkovskiy. Script is written by the brothers Strugatsky and based on the book of they named Roadside Picnic. 

This summer at home. Friend recommendation.

Adventure detective fiction movie.

The depicts a joerny of three men.

The main hero charackters guided a poet and scientiest through the place named "Zone" to the room where according the legend your wish can come true.

Losing hope man declined to make wishes, because the understand how pointless it is. 

The film is favorite because it's philosophic connotations embedded in the plot.

The line graph illustrating sales of five different vehicle types in Country A over three decades since 1990 with future predictions to 2020. In general, cars are more popular than vans and motorbikes, and sales of large cars and station wagons have dropped, while those of smaller cars have dramatic increased.
In 1990, large cars over 1.8 litres were the more popular vehicles sold, of about 2.7 million. Sale of both these cars and station wagons followed the same pattern to a steady decrease, to a low of around 2 million units in 2010. This falling in sales will continue to 2020. In contrast, smaller cars were less popular in 1990, by about 1.8 million sold, but sales increased significantly in the decade from 2000 to 2010, to a peak of 3.7 million. A smaller increase will expected in the next ten years.
Sales of both motorbikes and vans are remained steady at around 0.5 million per year and will continue to do so over the period.
